Since last class I have made a Repo for our project and added more details to our backlog.

I am going to continue to add to the backlog so we have a set path and instructions for our coding process.

So far no blockers in my work but I anticipate many blockers once I start working on the code

I've set our repo with the react app and have been looking at react tutorials to better understand how to implement what I want.

I want to really get to know how to use react but I still get easily confused

I've begun to implement styling for the website, however the styling is not implementing well because I have to edit a lot of the code in the javascript. I am working through the kinks and hopefully I get it running soon so I can merge it with the master code.

My main issue is making the code work, lots of little errors that must be fixed.
