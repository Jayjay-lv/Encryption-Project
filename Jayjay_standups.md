# Standups

Since last class I have made a Repo for our project and added more details to our backlog.

I am going to continue to add to the backlog so we have a set path and instructions for our coding process.

So far no blockers in my work but I anticipate many blockers once I start working on the code

I've set our repo with the react app and have been looking at react tutorials to better understand how to implement what I want.

I want to really get to know how to use react but I still get easily confused

I've begun to implement styling for the website, however the styling is not implementing well because I have to edit a lot of the code in the javascript. I am working through the kinks and hopefully I get it running soon so I can merge it with the master code.

My main issue is making the code work, lots of little errors that must be fixed.


## 4-25-19

Ive continued working on implementing the styling, Ive made a lot of progress and all that is left is to add a few things to the render and merge it with kobies code.

Miles found a router method to make the encryptions appear on different pages with my assistance

we will continue to polish our page next class

blocker might be making the page run smoothly seeing as their are some aspects of the router implementaion that was are unsure of what they do
