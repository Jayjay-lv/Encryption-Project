# Standups

## 2019-04-12

Since last class I have made a Repo for our project and added more details to our backlog.

I am going to continue to add to the backlog so we have a set path and instructions for our coding process.

So far no blockers in my work but I anticipate many blockers once I start working on the code

## 4-16-19

I've set our repo with the react app and have been looking at react tutorials to better understand how to implement what I want.

I want to really get to know how to use react but I still get easily confused

## 4-22-19

I've begun to implement styling for the website, however the styling is not implementing well because I have to edit a lot of the code in the javascript. I am working through the kinks and hopefully I get it running soon so I can merge it with the master code.

My main issue is making the code work, lots of little errors that must be fixed.


## 4-25-19

Ive continued working on implementing the styling, Ive made a lot of progress and all that is left is to add a few things to the render and merge it with kobies code.


## 4-26-19

I Implemented the code but it didn't work how I wanted it to so I am starting from scratch this time using Bootstrap

## 4-30-19

Added styling to input of page. still adding more but ran into an issue with some commands being undefined

## 5-01-19

I changed the bootstrap implementation so it actually works and the commands are no longer undefined. One issue might be learning how to import specific commands individually and also learning how to use bootstrap again.

I also worked on the challenge for class and got it to work relatively well

next class I plan on using bootstrap to get the website center and make it look more user friendly and less wonky

## 5-03-19

Added styling to page to make it look like 90's hacker website. I can't center the input box for the user so I need to find out ohow to do that.

I want to make it look more proffesional and add different pages and miles found a way but we need to find a way to do it with react.

##5-06-19

Added more styling. I centered everything and made the input text green. I plan on adding more to mkae it look more polished and user friendly. 


##5-06-19

Merged two branches and will continue to sperate the enryptions by pages so each encryption has its own page
