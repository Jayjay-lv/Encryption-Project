# Weekly Report

## 4-16-19

We've managed to set up our react app and have begun coding. Kobie and Matthew have looked at different encryptions. Weve deciced to implement 
our own encryption first and then add other already existing encryptions once we are down.

We've also figured out how to pull and push our code.

## Challenges
We are pretty unsure about our coding, we havent been able to implement code by ourselves.


## 4-26-19

We've completed making our first encryption and continued onto the next one. We attempted to implement a type of styling on the website but 
it didn't work so we have decided to use bootstrap for styling.

## Challenges
So far encryption is still proving a bit difficult but kobie and matthew are doing well. Jayjay and Miles are working on styling and while 
the styling that was implemented had sound code, it didn't work properly so we had to start from scratch, and this time we are using bootstrap
so we have to re-familiarize ourselves again.

## 5-03-19

We've added two encryptions and are currently working on decrypting, the code is coming along well. The styling portion is a bit further behind do to
issues we've run into with bootstrap. styling is pretty rudementary so far but we have a few ideas to make it look nice and proffesional

## Challenges

Syntax for bootstrap in react doesn't flow well so implementing styling has been rough. also seperating the encryptions into different pages 
might be a bit tedious. as far as coding the encryption is going well
