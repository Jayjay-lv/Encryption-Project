# standups 

## 2019-04-12

Since last class I created our backlog and added what we had from our google doc into our backlog. I also created my reports file and inputed my first standup


## 2019-04-16

Today we began work on our code. I created a few new functions (ie. encrpyt() decrypt()) matthew added an input box and I began the steps to encryption. I made it so the inputed text gets printed with an a added to the beginning and ending of the word or phrase.

- Today I finished implementing the first level of our ecryption and the decrytion for it as well. 
- Next class im going to try and begin researching and implementing our next level of encrytion(level 2) and the decryption for it as well
- some challenges I might face will be coming up with the higher level of encryption or potentially not making it myself and finding another encryption method online.
