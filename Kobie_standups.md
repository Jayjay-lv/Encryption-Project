# standups 

## 2019-04-12

Since last class I created our backlog and added what we had from our google doc into our backlog. I also created my reports file and inputed my first standup


## 2019-04-16

Today we began work on our code. I created a few new functions (ie. encrpyt() decrypt()) matthew added an input box and I began the steps to encryption. I made it so the inputed text gets printed with an a added to the beginning and ending of the word or phrase.

- Today I finished implementing the first level of our ecryption and the decrytion for it as well. 
- Next class im going to try and begin researching and implementing our next level of encrytion(level 2) and the 
- some challenges I might face will be coming up with the higher level of encryption or potentially not making it myself and finding another encryption method online.

## Daily Report 2019-04-25
- Today I began working on adding a second level of encryption and a second level decryption. I couldn't really get it to work the way I wanted so more or less I just ended up adding an outline for my future code. I also fixed the first encrytion method so it doesn't break if you use capital letters. 
- Next class im going to try and finish implementing the second level of encryprion and get it to print to the screen
- My main challenge will be to get the two levels of encrpytion to both print to the screen when someone inputs a message into the text box

## Daily Report 2019-04-26
- Today I continued working on the second level of encryption. With the help of Paul I was finally able to get the second encryption to print to the screen. Although currently the encryption 2 is not actually encrypting anything it just adds some @ symbols just so we could see if it would work
- next class im going to work on an actually encryption scheme for our second level of encryption and the decryption
- the big challenge will probably be trying to make the decryption once its already encrypted 

## Daily report 2019-04-30
- today matthew and I finished our second level enryption. It now changes the inputed message to symbols
- Next class im going to work on the decryption for it
- The challenge will be getting it to change back from symbols to letters.
