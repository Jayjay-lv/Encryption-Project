# Standups

## 2019 - 04 - 12

Since last class we have created a backlog for our repo
We have also created a repo that is shared with the whole group

Until next class, I will continue learning how to use github and will keep adding more to the backlog

My Blocker is my lack of knowledge/forgetfulness of github


## 2019-04-16

This class we worked on setting up the repo with react and started working on functions that will encode the plaintext

Until next class i will continue to read more on how react works

My blocker is my lack of knowledge/forgetfulness of github and react

## 2019-04-22

This class Kobie and I worked on creating and implementing an encryption algorithm into our react app. Our efforts were successful as we got a working input box that returned both ciphertext and plaintext

Until next class I will be thinking of new algorithms to add

My blocker is what new algorithms we should implement and how to style it

## 2019-04-25

This class Kobie and i fixed a problem with our program to be able to affectilvly use captitol letters. we also looked for more algorithms to use.

My blocker is my lack of code knowledge

## THE DAY OF ENDGAME

This Class i did more reaserch into what ciphers are and their history so i could have more knowledge about what we are coding so it makes it easier.

Untill next class i will continue reading more into how ciphers work

My blocker is coming up with a new cipher to create

## 4 days after Endgame(2019-04-30)

This class i created a seperate and new encrypting algorithm using option keys

Untill next class i will think of new encryptions

My blocker is finding out a way to de-encrypt the new algorithm

## 5 days after Endgame(2019-05-01)

This class i continued working on my 2nd level of encryption, which involves a seperate ceasar cipher.

Untill next class i will continue working on the encryption

my blocker are the mapping problems i am having with the encrypt

## 2019-05-03

This class i worked on bug fixes for the code to encrypt the 2nd level of plaintext

Untill next class i will continue with bug fixes and thinking of more ideas

My blocker is figuing out how to de-encrypt the 2nd level


## 2019-05-6

This class kobie and i worked on the decrypt for the second encryption, it was not easy and we have made little progress

Untill next class we will work on it

My blocker is the figuring out how to de encrypt

## 2019-05-8

This class kobie and i made progress on our decryption, while jayjay worked on merging some of the branches

Untill next class we will continue getting ready for the big merge

My blocker is the ceasar part of the decryption and having to shift back

## 2019-05-14

Today kobie and i did more work on the decypt and fixed some existing bugs with the ceasar shift

We will still prepare for the big merge

Our blokcer is still shifting to letters from the ceasar.

## 2019-05-16

Today kobie and i struggled with the decrypt, making little progress

We are preparing to be in mvp state

Our blocker is the decrypt2 function

## 2019-05-17

Today Kobie and i finally made a breakthrough with the decrypt, now having it sort of decrypt messages

We will still be working on the bug fixes

Our blockers are the bugs that we have to fix

## 2019-05-22

Today Kobie and i finally finished the decrypt 2 function after much hard work and trouble. It works as intened with no bugs as of yet

Jayjay is now preparing for the merge and our work is complete as programmers

## 2019-05-28

Today i decided to try and make a new encryption, and it failed. but i wont give yp on it yet

we are almost at the release verison.

## 2019-05-29

Today Riley helped me attempt a little side project i had, i wanted to use the same ecryption prossess for encrypt 2 but use a different alphabet. it works, but only to an extent, there are problems with the encrypting however the decrypt works well

I dont think we will be putting this in the project, as it is too finiky.
