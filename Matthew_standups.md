# Standups

## 2019 - 04 - 12

Since last class we have created a backlog for our repo
We have also created a repo that is shared with the whole group

Until next class, I will continue learning how to use github and will keep adding more to the backlog

My Blocker is my lack of knowledge/forgetfulness of github
