# Standups

## 2019 - 04 - 12

Since last class we have created a backlog for our repo
We have also created a repo that is shared with the whole group

Until next class, I will continue learning how to use github and will keep adding more to the backlog

My Blocker is my lack of knowledge/forgetfulness of github

This class we worked on setting up the repo with react and started working on functions that will encode the plaintext

Until next class i will continue to read more on how react works

My blocker is my lack of knowledge/forgetfulness of github and react

This class Kobie and I worked on creating and implementing an encryption algorithm into our react app. Our efforts were successful as we got a working input box that returned both ciphertext and plaintext

Until next class I will be thinking of new algorithms to add

My blocker is what new algorithms we should implement and how to style it
